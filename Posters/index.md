    <p>We invite researchers, practitioners, and doctoral students to submit posters and demos to the <strong>16th International Conference on Software Business (ICSOB 2025)</strong> based on the conference theme.

    <p>If accepted, authors are expected to design, print, and bring their posters to the session. The poster should briefly summarize the paper. Posters should be of size <strong>A1 (594 mm x 841 mm)</strong> and in <strong>portrait orientation</strong>. If authors remain unable to print their posters, we will print on behalf of the authors. However, authors are required to provide the poster file to the chairs well in advance to allow sufficient time for printing.</p>
  </div>

  <h2 class="section-title">Poster Design Guidelines</h2>
  <div>
    <h3>Layout</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Poster size should be A1 (594 mm x 841 mm). The poster should have an ample supply of push-pins.</li>
      <li>Poster should have a portrait, NOT a landscape layout.</li>
      <li>Consider borders during the print if you design your poster in tools such as Microsoft PowerPoint.</li>
      <li>The scale for images should be 1/1 so they do not appear stretched.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Content</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The poster shall contain the title, author(s), affiliation(s), and contact information of the main author.</li>
      <li>All materials on the poster should be easily readable from more than 1 m away.</li>
      <li>In general, posters should be self-supporting. Make sure the poster is structured logically, from top to bottom, or with a similar easy-to-follow logical structure.</li>
      <li>Try to reach a balanced mix of text and graphical content.</li>
      <li>Be as concise and brief as possible.</li>
      <li>Illustrations, graphics, and figures greatly increase readability. Minimize narrative and long paragraphs. Bullet lists are also a concise and effective way to communicate a series of points.</li>
      <li>Statistical data should be titled and summarized in a clear and concise format.</li>
      <li>Consider having a QR code to link your poster somewhere (e.g., bottom or top) in the poster to help raise attention for your research project.</li>
    </ul>
