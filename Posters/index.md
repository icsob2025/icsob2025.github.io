  <h2 class="section-title">Poster Design Guidelines</h2>
  <div>
    <h3>Layout</h3>
    <ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li>Poster size should be A1 (594 mm x 841 mm). The poster should have an ample supply of push-pins.</li>
      <li>Poster should have a portrait, NOT a landscape layout.</li>
      <li>Consider borders during the print if you design your poster in tools such as Microsoft PowerPoint.</li>
      <li>The scale for images should be 1/1 so they do not appear stretched.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Content</h3>
    <ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li>The poster shall contain the title, author(s), affiliation(s), and contact information of the main author.</li>
      <li>All materials on the poster should be easily readable from more than 1 m away.</li>
      <li>In general, posters should be self-supporting. Make sure the poster is structured logically, from top to bottom, or with a similar easy-to-follow logical structure.</li>
      <li>Try to reach a balanced mix of text and graphical content.</li>
      <li>Be as concise and brief as possible.</li>
      <li>Illustrations, graphics, and figures greatly increase readability. Minimize narrative and long paragraphs. Bullet lists are also a concise and effective way to communicate a series of points.</li>
      <li>Statistical data should be titled and summarized in a clear and concise format.</li>
      <li>Consider having a QR code to link your poster somewhere (e.g., bottom or top) in the poster to help raise attention for your research project.</li>
    </ul>
