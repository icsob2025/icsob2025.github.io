  <h1>Call for Research Paper Submissions</h1>

  <p>
    The theme for ICSOB 2025 revolves around the critical and timely topics of <strong>software business in digital societies</strong>. In an era where software permeates all aspects of society, software businesses play a critical role in driving economic progress and shaping individual and collective well-being.
